### Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) Simulation using Matlab and Simulink Modeling

Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) is a system that automatically adjusts the braking force of the wheels when the vehicle is braking. It can prevent the wheels from locking to obtain the best braking effect and improve the directional stability of the automobile. In this study, the ABS system model based on Matlab/Simulink will be introduced, including single wheel vehicle model, tire model and vehicle braking system model. 
Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) are used to control the wheel slip to keep the friction coefficient close to the optimal value. Wheel slip is defined as the relative motion between a wheel (tire) and the surface of the road, during vehicle movement. Wheel slip occurs when the angular speed of the wheel (tire) is greater or less compared to its free-rolling speed. To simulate the braking dynamics of a vehicle, we are going to simulate simplified mathematical models (quarter-car model) for both vehicle and wheel. Also, a simplified ABS controller is going to be implemented to emulate the braking torque in slip conditions.
